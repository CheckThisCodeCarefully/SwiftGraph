SwiftGraph
==========

SwiftGraph is a pure Swift (no Cocoa) implementation of a graph data structure, appropriate for use on both iOS and OS X projects. It includes support for weighted, unweighted, directed, and undirected graphs. It uses generics to abstract away both the class of the vertices, and the class of weights.

It includes copious in-source documentation, some unit tests, as well as utility functions for doing things like breadth-first search, depth-first search, and djikstra's algorithm.
